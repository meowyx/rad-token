# Sample ERC1155 Project

Created a simple ERC1155 smart contract for managing multiple tokens. The ERC1155 standard is great for creating fungible and non-fungible tokens, and the contract allows for efficient batch transfers as well. Overall, it's a versatile and powerful solution for managing various token types within a single contract.
